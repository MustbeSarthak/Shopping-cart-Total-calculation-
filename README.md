# Shopping-cart-Total-calculation-
This is a beginner-level C++ console application created purely for learning purposes.
The main goal of this project is to practice basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts and understand how they can be applied to solve simple real-world problems like calculating a shopping cart total.
The project focuses on clarity, logic building, and OOP fundamentals rather than advanced features.

# Purpose

Learn basic C++ syntax

Apply core OOP concepts (Class, Object, Encapsulation, Abstraction)

Practice loops, conditions, and user input

Understand how small programs can model real-life scenarios

This project is meant for educational use only.

# Features

Takes item name, quantity, and price

Applies 10% discount on items priced above Rs. 500

Adds a flat shipping fee of Rs. 50

Calculates and displays the final cart total

Simple console-based interfac

Uses basic OOP structure

# Concepts Used

Encapsulation

Basic Abstraction

Loops and Conditional Statements

Standard Input/Output

# Future Scope
Currently, there is no fixed future plan for this project. However, it can be extended later with features such as:

Storing multiple items using vectors

Adding a menu-driven system

Saving cart data to files

More discount rules
